The contents of this folder are to help bring those unfamiliar with various aspects of python relevant to the boot camp get up to speed.

The notebooks in this folder are meant to be completed in the following order:
0. Start Here - My first jupyter notebook
1. Introduction
2. a. Basic Python - Data Types
2. b. Basic Python - Conditionals and Loops
3. Writing Functions

For those of you that are looking to tackle all of the notebooks in this folder, <b>I encourage you to space this out</b>. This is a lot of content, especially if you are new to python. You want to be able to digest it in palatable bites. 

Perhaps even more importantly, <i>don't get discouraged!</i> Coding is hard and it takes time to get comfortable with something new. Be kind to yourself as you're going through and ask for help if you need it.
